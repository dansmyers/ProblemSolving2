## Official Course Description

**CMS 170 Problem Solving II**: Develops discipline in program design, problem solving, debugging and testing, with an introduction to data structures. Topics include: abstract data types, complexity analysis, and recursion. Basic data structures (queues, stacks, trees and graphs) and transformations (sorting and searching) are introduced as representative of the fundamental tools that are used to aid in software development. A high-level programming language is used to construct programs of a moderate size. Prerequisite: CMS 167/167L. (5 credits)

## What Will We Learn in This Class?

There's a perception that the field of computer science is
constantly changing, and in some respects that's true: there are
always new languages, frameworks, and application domain rising
up and old ones sinking down. Part of being a great computer
scientist is learning how to continually adapt yourself to new
ways of solving problems.

All of this change that we see around us, though, is like the **top
part of an iceberg**. The most visible elements of our field, like
languages and applications, are built upon and supported by a
**deeper layer of knowledge** that's mostly invisible to the casual
observer.

This course is about what's under the water, **the fundamental
things that support all of the computer science**, even if we don't
see them right away.

After completing this Algorithms course, you will have a deeper
understanding of many fundamental problem-solving strategies that
show up again and again throughout computer science. These 
include:

- Recursion
- Sorting algorithms
- Divide-and-conquer algorithms
- Fundamental data structures: trees and hash tables
- Algorithmic strategies: greedy, backtracking, branch-and-bound, dynamic programming
- Graph algorithms and their applications

## Learning Outcomes

At the end of this course, you will be able to:

1. Write medium-sized Java programs combining multiple object-oriented programming features.

2. Know and use the most common data structures: arrays, lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, search trees, and heaps

3. Be familiar with the concept of algorithmic complexity and be able to express the complexity of
common algorithms and data structure operations in Big-O notation.

4. Understand common algorithms for searching (linear and binary search) and sorting (simple quadratic sorts, quicksort, mergesort). Use 
complexity analysis to draw useful conclusions about their behaviors.

5. Design and implement recursive programs.

6. Intelligently discuss algorithm and data structure choices and tradeoffs.

## Textbook

We will use an online ZyBook covering Java, object-oriented programming, and data structures. The text includes built-in problems that 
you will complete along with the assigned homework projects. In most cases, the questions for each book chapter will be due at the same 
time as a programming project.

To access the text, create an account on the ZyBooks site, https://learn.zybooks.com. Enter the ZyBook code: 
ROLLINSCMS170MyersSpring2020. The subscription is $88 and lasts until after the final exam. Note that you can't subscribe to the book after the end of April, but it will remain open for you to access until the middle of May after final exams.

## The All-Important Grading Section

### Specs Grading
Grading for this course will also be different from your previous classes.

Rather than calculating your score as number of points on a 0-100 scale, your grade will be based on attaining **satisfactory** performance on a bundle of assignments. This approach is called **Specifications Grading** or **Contract Grading** and it has several advantages over the traditional 0-100 based points system.

If you achieve satisfactory performance on enough assigments, described in more detail below, you'll receive a baseline grade of **B** for the course. This demonstrates that you have engaged with the material and met the basic learning outcomes for the class. To get a higher grade, you can do more work that shows greater mastery of the course learning outcomes.

### Assignments and Scoring
We'll have five kinds of required assignments:

1. Approximately eight homework projects.
2. Autograded practice questions in the ZyBook, typically due with each project.
3. Short reflective self-assessments completed along with each project.
4. A written midterm exam.
5. A written final exam. The final will only cover the second half of the course.

I will grade most of the items you turn in on a two-level scale: your work will be either **satisfactory** or receive **no credit**. 
A "satisfactory" assignment corresponds to a B-level performance, which is **a higher standard** than we often associate with that term. It means that the work is:

1. Substantially complete and correct (there may be a few issues, but only minor ones).
2. Shows real understanding and application of the course material.
3. Completed on time in the required format.

I'll grade the exam problems on a scale from 0 to 2:

0. No answer, or too incomplete to grade.
1. Shows effort, but has serious issues.
2. Satisfactory.

You will receive satisfactory credit on an exam if you receive 80% of the total possible points.

### Final Letter Grades

**To earn a B**, you must meet the following six criteria:

1. Satisfactory completion of *N - 1* homework projects (I'll drop one bad project).
2. Satisfactory completion of at least 90% of the assigned questions on each ZyBook chapter.
3. Satisfactory completion of all reflective self-assessments.
4. Satisfactory completion of the midterm and final exams.

**If you fail to complete the requirements for a B**, your grade will be adjusted downwards according to the following table:

| For unsatisfactory performance on              | Your grade will be adjusted downwards by |
|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| One project beyond the one you're allowed to drop | Fraction of a letter grade (e.g. B to B-)       |
| Additional projects                            | A full letter grade (e.g. B to C) for each one     |
| The midterm exam                                 | A fraction of a letter grade (50% - 80%) or a full letter grade (less than 50%)                    |
| The final exam                                 | A fraction of a letter grade (50% - 79%) or a full letter grade (less than 50%)                      |
| Failure to complete all reflective assignments | A fraction of a letter grade                      |
| Failure to submit an assignment                | Double the regular penalty for an unsatisfactory submission |

These penalties are cumulative. For example, if you fail to achieve satisfactory performance on two quizzes (beyond the one you're allowed drop), your base grade would be lowered by 1.5 letters, from B to C-.

**To earn a higher grade**, you can complete additional work that shows deeper engagement with the course goals.

| For successfully completing                         | Your grade will be adjusted upwards by   |
|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| A challenge assignment (there will be at least two) | Half a letter grade                      |
| An in-depth reflective writing assignment           | Half a letter grade                      |
|            | Half a letter grade                      |

### Why Are You Doing This To Us?

1. In a traditional system, your grade is ultimately determined by my judgment of your work. My judgment is pretty good, but specs grading gives you more clarity about where you stand and guidance for how to achieve the grade you want

2. Your grade is directly tied to the learning that you demonstrate. The satisfactory work sets a baseline, but to earn a higher grade, you must demonstrate a higher level of engagement with the course material.

3. It gives you choices for how to attain higher grades. You don't have to do every project.

4. It's relatively easy to get a B if you do the required work, but hard to get an A. This preserves the integrity of the course, while still making it possible for everyone to succeed.

5. If you only need a B or a C, you can adjust your effort accordingly: the standards are transparent. You don't have to spend time on the most difficult assignments if you don't need them to get the result you want.

6. It reflects how you'll be evaluated in your career. Work assignments aren't graded out of 100% and your boss won't give partial credit for incomplete work. So, basically, I'm setting you up for massive career success.

### What About My Partial Credit?

You may feel uncomfortable about the two-level grading scale. This will pass.

1. Two-level grading is faster, so I will be able to return work more quickly and put more effort into giving you meaningful feedback.

2. Two-level grading is more consistent. It's easier to sort work into two bins, rather than slicing it into 100 possible points.

3. Each project will have a spec that clearly explains the requirements for satisfactory work. You can also ask me (through the expert request form) for an evaluation of your work-in-progress.

4. Again, industry doesn't give partial credit. If you're asked to code a feature or prepare a presentation, you're ultimately going to be evaluated on a pass / fail basis.

5. There are at least four ways to increase your grade. You only need three of them to move from the satisfactory B to an A.

## Course Policies

**Attendance** The only way to be consistently successful in your academic career is to regularly attend class meetings and participate in in-class activities. Therefore, while I do not mandate attendance at every single class, I expect full attendance every time we meet.

**Laptops** If you have a laptop, please bring it to class.

**Phones** Unlike laptops, I see few advantages to using phones during class. Please silence your phones at the beginning of class. Holding text conversations during class is both distracting and disrespectful and will not be tolerated.

**Late Submissions** Assignments are due on the stated day at the stated time. Speak to me in well in advance of the due date if you need an extension.

**Please speak to me if there are any issues making it difficult for you to succeed in class**. We can always work out a plan to deal with illness, work, or family responsibilities.

**Recording** No audio or video recording is permitted without prior permission.

**Canvas and GitHub** Most of the course material will be distributed through GitHub. We'll use Canvas to keep track of grades, announcements, and a few other things.

## Necessary and Proper Clause

As your course facilitator, I will make every effort to adhere to the topics and schedule described in this syllabus. However, I reserve the right to make changes for the good of the course.


## Honor Code
Membership in the student body of Rollins College carries with it an obligation, and requires a commitment, to act with honor in all things. The student commitment to uphold the values of honor--honesty, trust, respect, fairness, and responsibility--particularly manifests itself in two public aspects of student life. First, as part of the admission process to the College, students agree to commit themselves to the Honor Code. Then, as part of the matriculation process during Orientation, students sign a more detailed pledge to uphold the Honor Code and to conduct themselves honorably in all their activities, both academic and social, as a Rollins student. A student signature on the following pledge is a binding commitment by the student that lasts for his or her entire tenure at Rollins College:

> The development of the virtues of Honor and Integrity are integral to a Rollins College education and to membership in the Rollins College community. Therefore, I, a student of Rollins College, pledge to show my commitment to these virtues by abstaining from any lying, cheating, or plagiarism in my academic endeavors and by behaving responsibly, respectfully and honorably in my social life and in my relationships with others. This pledge is reinforced every time a student submits work for academic credit as his/her own. Students shall add to the paper, quiz, test, lab report, etc., the handwritten signed statement:
>
> **“On my honor, I have not given, nor received, nor witnessed any unauthorized assistance on this work.”**
>

Material submitted electronically should contain the pledge; submission implies signing the pledge.

## How Do I Interpret the Honor Code?
In the context of this class, my interpretation of the Honor Code pledge is that the work you submit for every assignment shall be your own original creation. This means that any item you submit must be written by you and you alone, or in an assigned group project by your group alone. Copying a complete solution from fellow class members, previous class members, books, or the Internet is a violation of this policy and will constitute academic misconduct.
