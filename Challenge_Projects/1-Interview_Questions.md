# Challenge Project: Interview Question Tutorial

## Description

If you are applying for a programming job, you may be required to perform a **TECHNICAL INTERVIEW**. In this extra project, you'll write
up a summary and solution to an example tech interview question and add it to a respository we're building.

These questions typically exercise your knowledge of core data structures, algorithms, and programming. 
For example, here's an example question I pulled almost at random from the Internet:

>A number is represented in a linked list such that each digit corresponds to a node in the list. Add 1 to it. 
>
>For example, the number 1999 would be represented as the list 
> 
> (1 --> 9 --> 9 --> 9)
>
> Adding 1 to it would change the list to
>
> (2 --> 0 --> 0 --> 0)

**If you complete this project, your final grade in the class will be increased by one part of a letter** (e.g. from B to B+).

**Your submission is due any time before the end of April 24** (the Friday before the last week of classes). Please plan ahead if you
want me to review your submission before you send it in, so we don't have traffic jams on the last day.

The goals of this project are:

- Practicing discipline-specific research skills and **clear** technical writing

- Reinforcing the key concepts we've studied in the first half of the class by teaching them to someone else.

- Gaining some insight into the meta-game of lesson planning and instructional design. Thinking about how you would teach something
can force you to think more carefully about how people learn things.


## Submission Details

Your submissions will go in this GitHub repo: [dansmyers/InterviewQuestionGuide](https://github.com/dansmyers/InterviewQuestionGuide)

- You'll fork the repo to create your own local copy.
- Add new files to your fork with the new content for your problems.
- Send me a pull request.
- I'll pull your changes into the master repository.

Eventually, we can build up a nice list of interview questions and explanations for future students.

## Tips on Selecting Problems

Choose a problem that relates to one of the major topics we've covered in the class:

- Recursion
- Searching and sorting
- Array lists
- Linked lists
- Stacks or Queues
- Hash Tables
- Trees

Your question should also require you to give a complexity analysis of the effective solution.

There are **many** sites that archive example interview problems (LeetCode and HackerRank are two popular ones). Reddit has several 
threads with example problems people have received in interviews. Spend some time looking around to find a problem that seems interesting
and requires some thought to solve.

What makes a good problem?

- It should effectively illustrate how to use a data structure, algorithm, or programming technique. Questions that rely on "tricks" or memorizing obscure facts about programming languages are not good.

- It should require some effort and thinking to arrive at the correct solution. A question like *How do you implement binary search?* is 
not very good, even though knowledge of binary search is important background knowledge for anyone familiar with algorithms.

**You are allowed to use other sources or references to help develop your solutions**.

## Submission Format

Create a new Markdown (`.md`) file in the GitHub repo for each problem. Write your solution using Markdown syntax and good formatting.
You can use my `README` files as references if you need to. [Here is a guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) to Markdown
that will help you format your write-up.

Your tutorials should include the following:

- A description of the problem.

- An example, illustrating the problem with some concrete data.

- A midpoint check-in, asking the reader to solve a basic example by hand.

- A description of the solution. This is the most important part of the write-up! Focus on the clarity of the solution. For some problems, it makes
sense to introduce the solution in stages, progressing from a straightforward but suboptimal solution to a good one.

- An illustration of the solution method applied to an example problem.

- Complexity analysis (using Big-O notation) for the solution.

- Code implementation, as appropriate. You can use pseudocode if that makes more sense for your problem.

- A final review question for the reader.
